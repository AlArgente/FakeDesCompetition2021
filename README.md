# Fake News Detection in Spanish Shared Task (FakeDes) 2021.

Code developed for the [FakeDes 2021](https://sites.google.com/view/fakedes). Here I reused the Attention Model from my Master's Thesis, but also probed Random Forest, XGBoost or SVM. The best results at training were the ones from the Attention Model, so I only uploaded this submission. 

I ran out of time to participate in the competition, so I didn't have time to use a HugginFace model from the transformers package. The idea was using a pre-trained model such as BERT or DistilBERT.

>> The fake news corpus in Spanish was used for the **Fake News Detection Task** in the **MEX-A3T** competition at the IberLEF 2020 congress. The details of the competition can be viewed in the main page of the [competition](https://sites.google.com/view/mex-a3t/).
